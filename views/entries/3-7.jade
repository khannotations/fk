    p Today our class and L3 / L4 had to get up at 8 a.m. to go by bus to Florence. First we went on a mini tour of the city, incredibly crowded with tourists but fairly interesting. We had tour guides to whom we listened through radios, so it was easy to not pay attention and check out things on our own. The main part of the day was spent in the Museo d’Uffizi, or the Museum of Officials, which had originals of dozens of famous paintings, including Botticelli’s Birth of Venus (unfortunately, we couldn’t take pictures inside). 
    p Because the tour guide was somewhat boring, Kate, who loves learning about stuff like this and knows literally every single fact about every major painting, gave a mini-tour on the side to a couple of us, which was much more interesting.
