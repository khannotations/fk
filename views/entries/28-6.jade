      span.title — the Disco!
    p As promised, I went out to watch the Euro semi-final Thursday night. Christina and I left a bit late, so as we were walking to the center piazza, the streets were deserted. Everyone was in a bar or at home watching the game. Whenever Italy scored in the first half, people would literally start screaming out of their windows. When we got to the piazza, it was packed and there were no seats, but we were able to find a spot along a fence where we could watch. I thought Germany played better in the second half, but they were unlucky and lost (though when they got the penalty kick in the 86th minute, everyone was a bit nervous). 
    p After the game, the people in the piazza paraded around—for a full hour and a half! We (Christina and I had met up with some other friends) kept expecting them to stop, but people kept singing the same songs over and over, waving flags and cheering all around the piazza. We went home pretty early though, because we had a test the next day.

    p At last, the first weekend in Siena! We had high hopes of finding some place to dance that night. After our test, I sadly went and changed my shoes to a more compatible pair. That night, John found a dance place (that may or may not have been a gay bar) and we literally took over the place: there were about 25 of us and 7 Italian people. We requested American songs to dance to (that my friend Yvette particularly enjoyed) and some of us even danced with Italian men. How scandalous!
