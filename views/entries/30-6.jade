      span.title — the Final
    p Because the night at the disco was so exhausting (also John, Robert and I talked for some three hours after coming home), I slept until 6 p.m. Saturday. After thinking really hard about starting my homework, I decided against it and went out with Robert to watch the Band of Siena’s Palio concert.  That night was not too intense because I wanted to save myself for the final Sunday night. Unfortunately, I had forgotten my keys at home, so had to wait until my friend Jake, who was kind enough to let me stay with him, went home.

    p I woke up around noon and went home (Jake’s host mom, Laura, was super kind) for lunch. The rest of the day, I did homework—and I have no recollection of what happened that night.
    p Just kidding. Evan, Laura, Kate and I met to stake out a spot at a restaurant to watch the game at six, but it turns out that was when there was the second “prova”, or trial run, for the Palio. I couldn’t believe that so many people would show up just to watch the horses trot around for 5 minutes! When that ended, we waited for a while as a restaurant set up its tables, ready to pounce when they gave the go-ahead, but we blinked for one second and all the tables were taken. Too bad. We went to a neighboring restaurant and watched the game, which was a depressing experience. After, Evan, Laura and I hung out for a long time: ‘twas quite peaceful.
