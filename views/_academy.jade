    h1.intro Rafi Khan for Khan Academy
    p Hello! I'm Rafi, currently a sophomore at Yale pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I feel as though I've spent a great deal of time over the past few years learning—which is great—but I now I'm yearning to apply that knowledge to something meaningful.
    p.centered Something like Khan Academy.

        p I didn't just pick Khan Academy out of a hat—I want to help because I think K.A. is making the biggest splashes in reforming education by using technology. I believe that the way we teach in schools needs to change fundamentally, and incorporating some computing shouldn't be out of the question.

        p And that's where I come in. I've been teaching, tutoring or refereeing soccer for almost a decade. I realize the power of knowledge, and love to spread it; I don't think that I've learned anything compeletely until I can explain it to a 10 year old. 
    p.centered I also love to code.
