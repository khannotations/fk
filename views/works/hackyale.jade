      |  is a student collaborative designed to meet an increasing demand 
      | for Computer Science knowledge at Yale. We're an organization that 
      | teaches Yalies how to build websites and program for the web—
      | completely for free. We empower hundreds of Yalies each year to 
      | build their ideas, and some even go on to get technical jobs at places 
      | like Google, Twitter and Facebook, as well as their own start-ups. 
      | So far, we offer semester-long classes as well as one-time workshops, 
      | see more than 600 applications—about 10% of the student body—
      | throughout the year. 

    p I taught the first ever summer-session, which was the Spring 
      | semester HTML/CSS/jQuery course presented in 10 intense days of 
      | coding and creating. Though it was an intro class, students came up 
      | with some pretty cool stuff, some of which are the official pages of 
      | some campus organizations. I continued to teach the frontend class 
      | during the 2012-2013, and during my tenure as director, plan to 
      | videotape HackYale classes and take them to the web.
