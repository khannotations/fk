    p GAKKO (
      a(href="//gakkoproject.com", target="_blank") gakkoproject.com
      | ) is an annual summer camp held in Japan that questions traditional 
      | approaches and reasons for learning. Frustrated by the obsession 
      | with exams and memorization in modern education, GAKKO brings 
      | together high schoolers, college students and professional artists and 
      | entrepreneurs from around the world, prodding them to think creatively and globally. 
    p I joined as Tech Director last year, advancing our educational goals, 
      | shaping direction for expansion, and managing GAKKOâ€™s website and Internet presence. 
      | Our website runs on Angular.js, backed by Ruby on Rails.
