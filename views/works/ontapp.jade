    p onTapp was a web application designed to facilitate ordering from restaurants online. Leveraging customized deals, networks and a scoring system, onTapp makes food-ordering more social and, well, more fun! The siteâ€™s back-end was originally written in Apache, PHP and MySQL, but switched early on to Node.js with Express, Jade and MongoDB. Server-side code was written in jQuery.
    p Though a fantastic learning experience developing my own company and product, the project turned out not to be something we wanted to pursue as a serious business.
