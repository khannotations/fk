            .desc_desc.block &nbsp;&nbsp;Completely discouraged by my utter lack of pitching ability, I resolved to create a somewhat fun app to help me distinguish pitches and harmonies better. The product was 'Gimme an Ear', which, in all honesty, turned out to be only somewhat helpful. GAE simply plays two notes together or distinctly, and the user's task is to identify the interval. The next step would be to introduce 3-note chords, or (when browsers can implement this natively), record the user humming and play it back. Then it would be possible to track progress over time, or introduce a level system, in which the challenges get harder and harder!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Written with Express and Jade in Node. Check it out

            .desc_desc.block &nbsp;&nbsp;Prom-proposing season is a dismal time for many. To liven up the general attitude and to foster a healthy sense of competition in my graduating class, I designed Promatch, an online bracket where Class of 2011'ers could vote on with whom they thought their classmates would go to prom (after signing in, of course, so they would be accountable for their choices).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;My first foray into web design, HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL, the site was no feat in design or implementation. But it was my first experience designing something for the sheer joy of it, and giving it away for free; a feeling on which I'm still hooked. The project was recently taken offlineâ€”the winner received a grand prize of supreme satisfaction.
